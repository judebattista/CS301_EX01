                Our game features a dinosaur in an urban setting. Thanks to the Lockian nature of the universe, the dinosaur and the city inhabitants establish
                an atmosphere of mutual respect as the underpinnings of burgeoning trust and friendship. THe player's goal as the dinosaur is to strengthen this incipient bond 
                leading to the collective success of the dinosaur/city symbiosis. Note: this feature is not yet implemented. In this prototype, the dinosaur just stomps 
                around and breaks shit. Hobbes was right!
